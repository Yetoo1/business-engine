# business-engine
This is supposed to create a simulated ecosystem of the user's choice. But this isn't a simulation with numbers and such, this is having a fully autonomous ecosystem where bank creates the money, business manages it and who dies first. Of course there's a lot of other factors and those will be added. But the tools each of the places will use are real tools, but an ai of sorts will input into the tools when needed. And and eventually you'll be able to spy on the empty business. Because if this was recrated in the real world, the human factor must be ommitted since the building is assumed to be empty.
